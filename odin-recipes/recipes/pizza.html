    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>A New York-style pizza is characterized by its thin, foldable crust that 
        strikes a perfect balance between crispness and chewiness. The crust is thin 
        enough to be easily folded, yet substantial enough to hold a generous layer 
        of classic tomato sauce and whole-milk mozzarella cheese. This iconic pizza 
        style is often adorned with a variety of toppings, from the traditional 
        pepperoni and sausage to mushrooms and bell peppers, creating a delightful 
        medley of flavors.</p>

    <p>
        The hallmark of a New York-style pizza lies in its simplicity and quality 
        ingredients. The emphasis on a straightforward yet well-executed combination 
        of crust, sauce, cheese, and toppings has made this pizza a beloved classic, 
        especially in the bustling streets of New York City. The result is a 
        delicious, satisfying slice that captures the essence of one of the world's 
        most iconic pizza styles.
