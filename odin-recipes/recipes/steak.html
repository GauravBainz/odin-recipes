    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>
        Steak frites, a beloved classic in French 
        cuisine, is a dish celebrated for its 
        simplicity and robust flavors. At its core, 
        steak frites consists of two main components: 
        a perfectly cooked steak and a side of golden,
         crispy French fries. The steak, often a cut 
         like sirloin or ribeye, is seasoned 
         generously, seared to a mouthwatering 
         medium-rare or medium doneness, and then 
         allowed to rest, allowing the juices to 
         redistribute for optimal tenderness.

        The accompanying frites, or fries, are a 
        crucial element, providing a satisfying 
        contrast in texture. These fries are 
        typically cut into slender, uniform strips, 
        then twice-cooked to achieve a crispy exterior
         and a fluffy interior. The combination of the
          succulent, flavorful steak and the crispy, 
          golden fries creates a delightful harmony 
          on the plate. Often served with a side of 
          aioli or a classic BÃ©arnaise sauce for 
          dipping, steak frites embodies the elegance 
          of French bistro cuisine while offering a 
          hearty and satisfying dining experience.
